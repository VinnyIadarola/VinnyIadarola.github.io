    "description": "A Java project created for my friend Ethan so he can improve at Valorant. The Cypher Setups application uses JavaFX for the frontend and pure Java for the backend. Users can install the program through a packaged installer built with jpackage and the WiX Toolset. Developers who want to modify the project can easily recompile the code using the provided Makefile. This project utilizes dynamic storage and maintaining default backup files in its bundled resources allowing users to expand the tool with a dedicated AppData folder. It has its own responsivity functions and image handling to ensure previews and galleries scale with window resizing and remain the same across scenes using a state manager. These elements make the tool both user-friendly and extensible, providing Valorant players with an organized platform for their Cypher strategies.",

The verification includes multiple test suites covering varied data sizes and entry counts, edge-case scenarios (empty/full, simultaneous operations), and timing checks to ensure functional correctness and synthesis compatibility. Ready for FPGA/ASIC flows and easy integration into larger designs.",

The goal is a tight, replayable loop where the user faces fog-of-war, destructible obstacles, and outmaneuvers through varied environments. Development is currently PAUSED while I learn more SDL3.",
